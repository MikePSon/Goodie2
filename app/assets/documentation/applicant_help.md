Cycles
---------

Cycles are the different iterations of a project. If your project will be a one-time only project, then create a single cycle to accept applications.

#### Application Questions

Currently, we offer you a bank of questions to ask of you applicants. When creating/managing a cycle, you can elect which of these questions to display.

#### Status Flow

- Planned: This cycle has been planned, and it's opening date is sometime in the future.
- Open: This cycle is now open, and applicants can apply to it.
- Closed: This cycle is no longer accepting applications. At this point applications are either under review, or in the process of being awarded.

When creating or managing cycles, you have the option to elect Open and Close dates. Every 15 minutes our application checks these values and determines whether or not to open or close a cycle automatically. Of course, you have the ability to Open and Close cycles manually as you see fit.

An important note about time. All times are assumed to be EST. As well, please note the 15 minutes above. So for example, setting an Open Time of 9:23 AM, the cycle itself will actually open at 9:30 AM. 


#### Closing cycles

When closing a cycle, whether automatically or manually, those applications which are not yet completed will be closed and given a status of incomplete.


Requests
---------

#### Application Creation

An applicant can only apply to your cycle while the cycle is open. You as a program administrator can create or modify an application at any point in time. In the future, we want to build out a feature to allow you to re-open a cycle, as well as allow you to enable the applicants to edit them on adhoc basis.

#### Statuses

Requests have a number of statuses they go through in the lifetime of the application.

- Created: The applicant has created the application, but has not yet clicked the Ready to Submit button.
- Submitted: The applicant has finalized their application, done by checking the Ready to Submit action.
- Incomplete: The cycle has closed, and the application was not completed.
- Under Review: The application is currently being reviewed by staff at your foundation.
- Closed: The application has been rejected
- Awarded: Your foundation has decided to accept the application and donate the requested money.
- Payment: Payments have been made to the recipient
- Project Complete: All payments have been issued and the project has wrapped up!

#### Support
We currently offer email based support through ZenDesk. We'll at least respond to your tickets within 24 business hours. Sometimes the solutions are simple, and we'll turn those around quickly. Sometimes they aren't so simple. If you are facing troubles with a live cycle, we'll automatically escalate that to the top of our queue.

#### Billing
Billing occurs monthly, in accordance with the subscription plan you signed up with. Currently, if you want to downgrade from our paid to our free tier, you have to send us an email. Don't worry, we won't try and sell you.

#### Cancelling
If you want to cancel your account entirely, you can do so by deleting your account under Edit Account.
