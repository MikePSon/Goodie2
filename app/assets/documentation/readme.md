Projects
---------

Projects are the top level objects used in giving. These projects may have repeat or you may use them only one time.

### Attributes

All projects have a name, how else are your applicants supposed to know what they are applying to? When creating or managing a project, you can add a couple of different attributes to the project.

- Repeat. If the project will repeat itself (for example, if you will offer this grant on a yearly basis). We allow you to select from monthly, quarterly, biannually, or annually.
- Budget. If the project has a budget, you can track your progress towards filling that budget here.


Cycles
---------

Cycles are the different iterations of a project. If your project will be a one-time only project, then create a single cycle to accept applications.

### Application Questions

Currently, we offer you a bank of questions to ask of you applicants. When creating/managing a cycle, you can elect which of these questions to display.

### Status Flow

- Planned: This cycle has been planned, and it's opening date is sometime in the future.
- Open: This cycle is now open, and applicants can apply to it.
- Closed: This cycle is no longer accepting applications. At this point applications are either under review, or in the process of being awarded.

When creating or managing cycles, you have the option to elect Open and Close dates. Every 15 minutes our application checks these values and determines whether or not to open or close a cycle automatically. Of course, you have the ability to Open and Close cycles manually as you see fit.

An important note about time. All times are assumed to be EST. As well, please note the 15 minutes above. So for example, setting an Open Time of 9:23 AM, the cycle itself will actually open at 9:30 AM. 


#### Closing cycles

When closing a cycle, whether automatically or manually, those applications which are not yet completed will be closed and given a status of incomplete.
